<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Twice every week a poor, thin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holding his little daughter&#8217;s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked feebly to a hospital,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Close by the busy London Strand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hoped the clever doctors there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In time would make him strong and well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he might go to work again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And live to care for little Nell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beside wee Nell, her faithful friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good old dog Tray was always seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a day apart the pair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since Nelly&#8217;s babyhood had been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But all the doctors&#8217; skill was vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor William Bruce soon passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving his little orphan child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without a friend&mdash;save poor dog Tray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The little money he had saved<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He left to his landlady&#8217;s care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Nelly, till she older grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The woman&#8217;s humble home might share.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He thought her honest&mdash;but, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most sadly was poor Bruce deceived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kept herself the orphan&#8217;s gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That as a trust she had received.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She dressed poor little Nell in rags,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All her good, decent clothes she sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scarcely gave her daily bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kept her shivering in the cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For in an empty loft she slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ragged blanket all her bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there till sleep her sorrow hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor Nelly&#8217;s nightly tears were shed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ever crouching at her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pitying love lay faithful Tray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He nestled up to keep her warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked her bitter tears away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Nelly shared with him her crusts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And both were hungry and forlorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While many a kick and cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most patiently by Tray were borne.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the cruel woman said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She had no bones to throw away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could not keep a useless cur,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She really must drive off old Tray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, with a broomstick in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She hunted the poor dog about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, with many a cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From his old home she drove him out.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Limping and howling forth he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Nelly, with a breaking heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With agonizing sobs and cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beheld her only friend depart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the hospital that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The porter with amazement saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog appear, who limped along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holding well up an injured paw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straight to the doctors&#8217; room he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Jumped on a chair, held up his leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed by a beseeching whine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their kindly aid and skill to beg.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laughing, the kind house-surgeon said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;A stranger patient I ne&#8217;er saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let us see what we can do,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old fellow, let me hold you paw.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He found Tray had a broken leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And set and bound it up so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Tray, delighted and relieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sought all his gratitude to tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He wagged his tail and loudly barked,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked the surgeon&#8217;s kindly hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried to make his human friend<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His thanks and joy thus understand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, turn him out!&#8221; the doctors cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;The sleeping patients he will wake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot have their rest disturbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By letting him this hubbub make.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The porter then put poor Tray out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But gave him, when they reached the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mutton bone, well covered yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Tray was very glad to eat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now in the streets the dog must live;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But far far from Nell he would not stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He howled about her home all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lingered near it all the day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor Nelly in her dismal loft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That mournful sound in sleep would hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiles would play upon her lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because in dreams her friend was near.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The landlady, who could not sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Tray&#8217;s loud howling, angry grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her guilty conscience he awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now no peace or rest she knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length one morning, in her wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gave poor Nell a cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade her join that yelping cur,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with him, begging, henceforth go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The child fled screaming to the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Tray in ambush always lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leaped upon her with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Nelly pushed her friend away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, Tray!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you hurt my arm,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;The arm she struck&mdash;&#8220;Oh, how it aches.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her little trembling hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fallen arm she shrinking takes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tray at his little mistress looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With thoughtful eyes and wagging tail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seems as if he understood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why Nelly screamed and looked so pale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With a loud bark he seizes then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The little maiden&#8217;s ragged gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulls her rapidly along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down to the busy crowded town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the hospital they reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Tray before found kindly aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nelly is dragged quickly in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though trembling now and much afraid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drew her to the doctors&#8217; room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight up to his former friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wistful eyes and bark that asks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Will you to this poor child attend?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why, what is it?&#8221; the surgeon cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Another patient do you bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child, too&mdash;speak, poor little one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can we for you do anything?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Nelly, sobbing, shows her arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;&#8216;Tis broken!&#8221; all the doctors say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They set it, and then call a nurse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Nelly in the house must stay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon in a snowy little bed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The suffering child is snugly laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! what a change from the bare loft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where in the dark and cold she stayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And dainty food is to her brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While gentle words and tender smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothe the slow hours of burning pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pity half her grief beguiles.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center">[Please click on the image for a bigger image.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet the nurse sees an anxious look<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the wide eyes of loveliest blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asks what troubles Nelly still&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What more for her they all can do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh! please,&#8221; said Nelly, &#8220;do not think<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am not happy&mdash;you&#8217;re too good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never was in such a room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I never tasted such nice food.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Only&mdash;I do so want to know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What has become of old dog Tray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brought me here&mdash;my only friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where is he gone?&mdash;oh, tell me, pray.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;My darling,&#8221; said the smiling nurse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Your clever dog is safe and well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor who lives in the house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has found a place where Tray may dwell.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Nelly gently fell asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from that moment better grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the nurse&mdash;her tender friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hapless orphan&#8217;s story knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Indignant at such cruelty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nurse the kindly surgeon seeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of poor Nellie&#8217;s hapless lot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With warm, indignant pity speaks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;What&#8217;s the child&#8217;s name?&#8221; the doctor asked.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Eleanor Bruce,&#8221; the nurse replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Her father was a patient here<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For many months before he died.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Bruce? Yes, I well remember him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He told me of a little store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had laid by for this poor child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8216;Twas thirty pounds, I think, or more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The dog has saved poor Nelly&#8217;s life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And brought to light a cruel wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wondrous instincts, God&#8217;s great gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To His dumb creatures do belong.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Nelly&#8217;s broken arm was healed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The doctor took her to his home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not let the helpless child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">About the streets of London roam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The housekeeper the child attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Tray with wild joy greets her there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more he watches at her side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They are a glad and happy pair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cruel landlady one day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was sitting by her fireside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced that she had gained the gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meant for poor Nelly to provide.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When open flew the kitchen door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in a tall policeman came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid his hand upon her arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gruffly called her by her name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behind him, then, the woman saw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The child whom she had driven away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near, a stately stranger stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While at her growled the old dog Tray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They charged her with her cruel theft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her guilt she angrily denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tall stranger, stern and grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With solemn voice and words replied,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Her father told me he had saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And given his gold to you, his friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep his little, helpless child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And on her wants the sum to spend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;But you have kept that hard won sum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And driven his orphan out to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, what does such a crime deserve?&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The guilty soul cannot reply.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They made her give up all that&#8217;s left,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They would have sent her off to jail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nelly&#8217;s voice for pardon prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nelly&#8217;s tears and prayers prevail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wicked woman&#8217;s heart was touched<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the sweet pity of the child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repentant tears ran down her cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As Nelly&#8217;s words fell soft and mild.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They left her to her grief and shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more will little Nelly stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her power to harm or kill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She goes with her new friends away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The surgeon&#8217;s mother heard the tale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A very strange and touching one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how the dog, with instinct strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had sought the succour of her son.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And how poor Nelle he had brought<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To ask for her the same kind aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how a wicked woman&#8217;s sin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had been by this same act betrayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, dwelling in her home alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She asked her son the child to send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell with her and cheer her age,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By being a merry little friend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She wished, too, that the dog should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in her house with Nelly dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trusty guardian for them both,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Certain to do his duty well.<br /></span>
